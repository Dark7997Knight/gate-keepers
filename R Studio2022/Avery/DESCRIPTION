Description:

Test Ferlization of Fish Eggs within a controlled setting environment by utilizing statistical 
    data that was collected by Ichthyologist marine biology scientists that collected samples 
    of female lake trout located at the southernmost point of Lake Ontario, Canada, 
    at 41°41'N, 82°41"W (41.685,-82.684), or about 41.7 degrees north latitude. 
    just south of Pelee Island during the winter months of September and November
    to form a timeline from 2002-2004.
    Factors to be taken into consideration are: 
    One measure of the viability of fish eggs is percent dry mass(PctDM) 
    which reflects the energy potential stored in the eggs by recording the percentage of the total 
    egg material that is solid. 
    Values of the PctDM for a sample of 35 lake trout (14 in September and 21 inNovember) are 
    given in this dataset along with the age (in years) of the fish.  
    A data frame with 35 observations on the following 4 variables.
    Age <-	Age of the fish (in years)
    PctDM	<- Percentage of the total egg material that is solid
    Month	<- Month fish was caught: Sep=September or Nov=November
    Sept Indicator with <- 1=September or 0=November
